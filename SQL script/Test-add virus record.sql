    'ToMV',
    '• Belongs to the family of Virgaviridae\n • Is a plant pathogenic virus\n • Commonly found in tomatoes and many other plants',
    '1. LEAVES:\n •	Light green mosaic patterns on the leaves\n • Alternating yellowish and darker green areas\n 2. APPEARANCE:\n Leaves appear to be fern like in appearance and tend to have pointed tips\n 3. FRUIT:\n •	Bronze and patchy appearance develops on the fruit\n •	Distorted, yellow blotches, necrotic spots on fruit\n',
    '1. TIMING OF CAUSE:\n Any time during the growing season\n 2. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:\n•	Environmental conditions influence the symptoms\n •	Influencing factors:\n Temperature, day length, intensity of light, variety, plant age at the time of infection\n 3. MEANS OF INFECTION:\n • Infected seed\n • Small number of infected seedlings are enough for virus to spread rapidly\n • Contaminated tools, hands and clothes of workers\n',
    ' ',
    '1.	NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n •Remove plants with symptoms Promptly to prevent the spread of the virus to nearby healthy plants\n • On handling infected plants, it’s necessary to wash tools and hands in hot soapy water\n • Tools should be sterilised using a disinfectant (Virkon S)\n •	Avoid growing new plants in close proximity if you suspect your plants are infected\n 2. CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n No chemical controls available',

    '• Target spot attacks leaves or stems of tomato plants\n •Also called as leaf spot\n •Scientific Name: Corynespora cassiicola\n •Distribution: Widespread\n',
    '• Brown and black spots appear on leaves, which keeps on spreading\n •	Disease starts on the older leaves\n • Spread of virus is rapid, and the plant loses its leaves quickly\n 2. APPEARANCE: \n• The spots are oval to angular in shape\n •	They form series of concentric circles\n • The spots grow up to 10-12 mm\n 3. FRUIT:\n • Difficult to identify target spot on tomato fruit in early stage\n • Circular spots with velvety black fungal lesion are observed after the diseased tomato ripens\n',
    '1. TIMING OF CAUSE: Any time during the growing season'\n 2. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:\n •	Moderate temperatures\n • High moisture\n 3. MEANS OF INFECTION:\n • Infected seed\n • Remains of earlier infected plants or host species\n',
    ' ',
    '1.	NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n • Remove debris of old plants at the end of growing season\n • Avoid planting in the areas where diseased plants where located in the past years\n • Plants should be grown in sunlight with proper air circulation\n •	Avoid crowding of plants\n • Remove branches from lower part of the plants for better airflow\n 2. CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n • Chemical products used:\n o Mancozeb\n o copper oxychloride\n o chlorothalonil\n • Plants should be treated when the first spots are seen and should be sprayed at 10-14 days interval for three-four weeks\n • Should be sprayed on both sides of the leaves\n',

    '1. LEAVES:\n •	Leaves have small (<1/8 inch), brown, circular spots encircling a yellow halo\n • Sunken upper leaf surface\n 2. APPEARANCE: Spots are about 3 mm and usually found on tips and margins of leaves\n 3. FRUIT:\n • Fruit spots are ¼ in inch\n • Slightly raised, scabby, and brown\n • Fruit has a waxy white halo surrounding\n',
    '1.	TIMING OF CAUSE:\n Any time during the growing season\n 2. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS:\n • High temperatures\n• High humidity\n •	Overhead irrigation\n •	Frequent rainfall\n 3. MEANS OF INFECTION:\n • Infected seed\n',
    ' ',
    '1.	NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n • Grow plants from infection free seeds\n •	Purchase high quality seeds\n •	Use hot water treatment to kill bacteria in seeds\n • Avoid high pressure sprays\n • Rotate between crops\n • Remove crop debris at the end of the growing season\n • Disinfect pruners and tools by dipping in commercial sanitizer\n 2. CHEMICAL CONTROL:\n• Copper fungicides or\n •	Copper plus mancozeb\n • Chemicals should be sprayed at 7-10 days interval in the field\n •	Spray early when plants are young',
